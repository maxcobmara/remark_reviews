1.  Inspect the following short pieces of code:

    PHP
    $a = '1';
    $b = 2;
    $result = $a+$b;

    echo $result;
    > 3


    Javascript
    var a = '1';
    var b = 2;
    var result = a + b;
    document.write(result);

    12

    What is the value of '$result' (PHP, 3) and result (JS, 12)?

2.  Describe (in pseudo-code) a short algorithm which prints all primenumbers from 1 until 10.000

3.  Describe (in pseudo-code) a recursive method that is able to print the n-th number in the fibonacci series.
    Fibonacci: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 etc
